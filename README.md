# **My Portfolio Site 2025**

My updated portfolio site for 2025, made using **HTML** and **CSS**.

## **Inspiration**
This site is my own creation but is heavily inspired by designs from other public projects and companies. Notable inspirations include:

- **[US Graphics Company](https://usgraphicscompany.com/)**  
  My site's layout and design philosophy were significantly influenced by the minimalist and functional aesthetics of the US Graphics Company.
  
- **[Monospace Web Project](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/)**  
  The decision to redo my portfolio stemmed from this project's unique approach to design and simplicity.

- **[Nothing's Design Language](https://nothing.tech/)**  
  Specifically, I drew inspiration from their font-face and overall typographic style, which aligns with my minimalist design goals.

## **Features**
- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
- Highlighted projects showcasing machine learning, cybersecurity, and software development work.
- Clean typography inspired by modern design principles.

## **Technology Used**
- **HTML5** for structuring content.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout design.
- **Google Fonts** for custom typography.
